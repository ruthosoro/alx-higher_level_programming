Let's start with input. In Python, you can use the input() function to prompt the user for input. It displays a message to the user and waits for them to enter a value. The value entered by the user is returned as a string. Here's an example:
python

name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "! Nice to meet you.")

In this example, the user is prompted to enter their name, and the value they enter is stored in the variable name. We then use the print() function to display a personalized greeting.

Moving on to output, Python offers several ways to display information to the user. The most common one is using the print() function. It takes one or more arguments and displays them on the console. Here's an example:
python

print("Hello, world!")

In this case, the message "Hello, world!" will be printed to the console.

Additionally, you can format the output using placeholders and the .format() method. Here's an example:
python

name = "Kevin"
age = 25
print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))

Here, we use {} as a placeholder for the values of name and age. The .format() method is then used to substitute the placeholders with the actual values.

Another useful technique for output is writing to files. You can open a file using the open() function and then write to it using the .write() method. Here's an example:
python

file = open("output.txt", "w")
file.write("This is some text that will be written to the file.")
file.close()

In this snippet, we open a file called "output.txt" in write mode ("w"). We then use the .write() method to write a string to the file. Finally, we close the file using the .close() method.

Remember, handling input and output is crucial in any programming language, as it allows your programs to interact with users and external data sources. With Python, you have a variety of options for input and output, making it flexible and easy to work with.
